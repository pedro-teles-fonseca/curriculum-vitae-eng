# Curriculum Vitae :books:

This is my long, academic-style [CV](https://github.com/pedro-teles-fonseca/curriculum-vitae-eng/blob/master/Pedro-Fonseca-CV.pdf) built with LaTeX. It is inspired in [this](https://texblog.org/2012/04/25/writing-a-cv-in-latex/) blog post and in [this](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/freeman-cv) template.

<a href="https://github.com/pedro-teles-fonseca/curriculum-vitae-eng/blob/master/Pedro-Fonseca-CV.pdf"><img class="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pedro-teles-fonseca/curriculum-vitae-eng/master/images/sample.png" width="200"/></a>

In case anyone wants to use it as template:

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Change the name of `Pedro-Fonseca-CV.tex` to something like `Your-Name-CV.tex`
3. Open and edit `Your-Name-CV.tex`
4. Compile with XeLaTeX
5. Profit :moneybag:
